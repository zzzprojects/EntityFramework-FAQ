## What is Entity Framework Code First? 

When you start learning Entity Framework, you will often see the term **Entity Framework Code First**. Code first is one of the three approaches to create an entity model.

## Answer

In Entity Framework, code first was introduced in Entity Framework 4.1. Code First modeling workflow targets a database that doesn't exist, and Code First will create it.

Code-First APIs will create the database on the fly based on your entity classes and configuration. It can also update the database if the model changes, using a feature called Code First Migrations.

 - Code First is very popular approach and has full control over the code rather than database activity. 
 - In this approach, we can do all the database operations from the code and manual changes to database have been lost and everything is depended on the code.
 - In this you need to create POCO entities as data model.
