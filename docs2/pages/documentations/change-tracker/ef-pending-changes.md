# EF Pending Changes

## How can I see pending changes? 

I'm creating an application with the ADO.NET Entity Framework and can step through my code line-by-line while debugging and watch SQL Server Profiler for every query executed, but I can't figure out where all those SQL commands are coming from!

Sometimes when I execute SaveChanges(), the Entity Framework performs unexpected, weird **INSERTS**. How can I monitor the pending changes that queue up waiting for a SaveChanges() call?

## Answer

Entity Framework has a `ChangeTracker` property in DbContext class which provides access to features of the context that deal with change tracking of entities..


```csharp
using (var ctx = new EntityContext())
{
    //code here

    var addedEntries = ctx.ChangeTracker.Entries()
        .Where(e => e.State == EntityState.Added).ToList();

    var modifiedEntries = ctx.ChangeTracker.Entries()
        .Where(e => e.State == EntityState.Modified).ToList();

    var deletedEntries = ctx.ChangeTracker.Entries()
        .Where(e => e.State == EntityState.Deleted).ToList();
}
```

The `Entries()` method returns DbEntityEntry objects for all the entities tracked by this context.
