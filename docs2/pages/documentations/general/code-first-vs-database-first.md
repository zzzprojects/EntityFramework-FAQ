## Answer

### Code First Approach

 - Code First is a very popular approach and has full control over the code rather than database activity. 
 - In this approach, we can do all the database operations from the code and manual changes to database have been lost and everything is depending on the code.
 - In this you need to create POCO entities as data model.

### Database First Approach

 - Database first approach is used when database is ready then Entity Framework will complete his duty and create POCO entities for you.
 - If you have already a designed database and you don't want to do extra effort then you can go with this approach.
 - You can modify the database manually and update model from database. 
 - So, we can say, entity framework is able to create your model classes based on tables and columns from relational database.
