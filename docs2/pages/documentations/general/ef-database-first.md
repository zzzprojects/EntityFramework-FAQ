# EF Database First

## What is Entity Framework Database First? 

When you start learning Entity Framework, you will also often see the term **Entity Framework Database First**. Database first is one of the three approaches to create an entity model.

## Answer

In Entity Framework, the Database First Approach provides an alternative to the Code First by creating POCO classes from the existing database.

 - Database first approach is used when database is ready, then Entity Framework will complete its duty and create POCO entities for you
 - If you already had a designed database and you don't want to do extra efforts, then you can go with this approach.
 - You can modify the database manually and update model from database. 
 - So, we can say, entity framework is able to create your model classes based on tables and columns from relational database.
