## Answer

***DbContext** has a constructor overload that accepts the name of a connection string or a connection string itself. Implement your own version and pass it to the base constructor.


```csharp
public CustomerContext( string connectionString) 
        : base(connectionString)
{
}
```

Then simply pass the name of a configured connection string or a connection string itself when you instantiate your DbContext.


```csharp
using (var context = new CustomerContext("connection string 1"))
{
    //code here
}

using (var context = new CustomerContext("connection string 2"))
{
    //code here
}
```
